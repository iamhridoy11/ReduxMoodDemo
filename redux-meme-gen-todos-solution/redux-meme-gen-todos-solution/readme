# **React + Redux Exercises**

## **Part 1 - Meme Generator - Redux**

Your application should do the following:

- Allow for the creation of a meme with a top and bottom text
- Allow for the removal of memes
- Your memes should be stored in Redux

## **Part 2 - React / Redux Todos**

It’s another throwback to your todo app! Instead of storing todos in React state, move them to Redux state.

Your application should do the following:

- Allow for the creation of todos
- Allow for the deletion of todos

Be thoughtful about which component(s) need to ***useSelector*** to get data from Redux state.

## **Further Study**

- Add unit tests for your reducers
- Add functionality for updating memes
- Add functionality for updating todos
- Store your memes in localStorage
